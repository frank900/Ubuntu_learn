1. 
use // instead of /*...*/ for comments. page 33.

2.
printf("dec = %d; octal = %o; hex = %x\n", x, x, x);
printf("dec = %d; octal = %#o; hex = %#x\n", x, x, x);
//the output result is 
dec = 100; octal = 144; hex = 64
dec = 100; octal = 0144; hex = 0x64

3.
a system with a 16-bit int and a 32-bit long treats the integer 7 as 16 bits 
and the integer 7L as 32 bits. The l and L suffixes can also be used with octal
and hex integers, as in 020L and 0x10L.

Similarly, on those systems supporting the long long type, you can use an ll or 
LL suffix to indicate a long long value, as in 3LL . Add a u or U to the suffix 
for unsigned long long , as in 5ull or 10LLU or 6LLU or 9Ull .
